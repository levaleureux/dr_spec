# TODO: HELP !!!
# I have no idea on how to test it. If you have some clue...
# please write on the dragonruby discord #oss-dr_spec
#
# For now,I think only way to do it, is with a meta test and a way to colect the runned specs list ?
#
#require 'spec_helper'
#require 'fileutils' # Assurez-vous d'inclure le module FileUtils

# spec :metadata do
#   #include FileUtils # Inclure le module FileUtils pour utiliser ses m√©thodes

#   context "metadata can be use to filter some groupe of spec" do
#     let(:command) { "../dragonruby . --eval app/tests.rb --no-tick #{tag_filter}" }
    
#     context "when there is no flag" do
#       let(:tag_filter) { "" }
      
#       before(:each) do
#       end
      
#       # For real focus no focus method we need that dr_spec:
#       # 1. can target
#       # 2. can have good specific require chaine
#       context "when there is some focus method" do
#         it "run the command" do
#           system "echo '#{command}'"
#           system command
#           system "command done"
#         end
#       end

#       context "when there is no focus method" do
#       end
#     end
    
#     context "when there is flag" do
#       let(:tag_filter) { "spec-focus-tags player,levels" }
      
#       context "when there is some focus method" do
#         it "run the command" do
#           system "echo '#{command}'"
#           system command
#           system "command done"
#         end
#       end
